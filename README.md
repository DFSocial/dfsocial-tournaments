As a gamer, in order to participate in DFSocial's tournaments you'll need to lock a certain amount of tokens based on the tournament's tier. These tokens are always unlocked after 1 month. If you're new to crypto you can find a Sponsor on our Discord https://dfsocial.link/discord in #sponsor-marketplace channel. Sponsors can register gamers by locking their tokens and earn 50% of the rewards of their gamers, all secured by DFSocial Smart Contracts.
